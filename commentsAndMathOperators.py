"""
basic mathematical operators practice:
1.create a variable called add and assign it the sum of two numbers
2.create a variable called sub and assign it the difference of two numbers
3.create a variable called mult and assign it the product of two numbers
4.create a variable called div and assign it the quotient of two numbers
5.create a variable called power and assign it the value of a number raised to a power
6.create a variable called mod and assign it the remainder of a quotient
"""

add = 34 + 0.43
print(add)

sub = 45-9.04
print(sub)

mult = 34*0.12
print(mult)

div = 34//3
print(div)

power = 2**5
print(power)

mod = 24%5
print(mod)

"""
modulo practice:
1.create a variable called mod1 and assign it the result of 7 % 5
2.create a variable called mod2 and assign it the result of 16 % 6
3.create a variable called mod3 and assign it the result of 4 % 3
"""

mod1 = 7%5
mod2 = 16%6
mod3 = 4%3
print(mod1,"\n",mod2,"\n",mod3)


"""
order of operations practice:
1.create and assign a variable called ordOp1 the result of 7 + 6 + 9 - 4 * ((9 - 2) ** 2) / 7
2.create and assign a variable called ordOp2 the result of (6 % 4 * (7 + (7 + 2) * 3)) ** 2
"""

ordOp1 = 7 + 6 + 9 - 4 * ((9 - 2) ** 2) / 7
ordOp2 = (6 % 4 * (7 + (7 + 2) * 3)) ** 2
print(ordOp1," ",ordOp2)
